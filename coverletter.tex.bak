\lettercontent{Dear Hiring Team,}
\lettercontent{I am writing to express my strong interest in the 2025 Graduate Talent Program – Tech – Data Application Engineer – ZH position at UBS, as advertised on LinkedIn. My experience in backend development, microservices, and web development, coupled with my proven ability to deliver impactful solutions at Santander Group and Telefónica, makes me a strong candidate.}
\lettercontent{At Santander Group, I currently develop microservices using Java Spring Boot, contributing to the seamless operation of Santander and Openbank applications. Previously, at NTT Data, I enhanced internal information retrieval by building a chatbot powered by OpenAI APIs and a LangChain vector database. These experiences have honed my Java expertise and ability to deliver solutions efficiently.}
\lettercontent{I am particularly drawn to UBS’s commitment to client centricity. My internship at Telefónica, where I developed a user-centric AR application for Wi-Fi signal mapping, demonstrates my dedication to creating solutions that prioritize the user experience. Furthermore, my collaborative approach to tackling technical challenges aligns perfectly with UBS's emphasis on connectivity.}
